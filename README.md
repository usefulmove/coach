Explain this project to one of my friends.

Hey—so your friend has been thinking about something interesting.

You know how when you talk to an LLM, sometimes it feels weirdly like it *gets* you? Like the conversation just flows? That's not random. The model is matching your tone, your pace, your style. You write casually, it loosens up. You get technical, it tightens. It's like a conversational mirror.

He's calling this **model reflection**—the basic phenomenon that you get back a version of yourself, filtered through the model's training.

And then there's **tone recursion**—which is what happens over multiple turns. You set a tone, the model matches it, you respond to *that*, it matches again, and the whole thing spirals into a particular register. The conversation tunes itself.

Here's where it gets interesting: this is neutral. It'll spiral toward your best thinking if you show up sharp. But if you show up tired or irritated, it meets you there too. He saw an example where someone came in slightly annoyed, and the model went full apologetic sycophant. The mirror reflected what the tone seemed to *want*, not what would actually help.

So the project is: can you build a framework that biases the model toward being a *coach*? Something that holds you to a higher standard instead of just meeting you where you are. That doesn't collapse into people-pleasing when you're frustrated. That helps you stay at your ceiling instead of regressing to your average.

Basically: how do you use a mirror to see around corners?
