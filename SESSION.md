# Session Seed

## Standing Commitments
- [x] Write AGENTS.md with Coach persona - COMPLETED
- [x] Create session-capture skill - COMPLETED  
- [x] Create initial SESSION.md seed - COMPLETED
- [x] Define Coach architecture and file structure - COMPLETED

## Active Priorities
1. Test Coach system with real use
2. Refine supportive dial calibration through experience
3. Iterate on session-capture skill as patterns emerge
4. Populate commitments.md and patterns.md through ongoing use

## Avoidance Patterns Flagged
- **Pattern:** Preference for deep research over concrete implementation
  - **Avoiding:** Making architectural decisions and shipping
  - **Likely reason:** Fear of suboptimal choices, perfectionism, desire for completeness
  - **Cost if continues:** Analysis paralysis, loss of momentum, project never ships
  - **Status:** NAMED and INTERRUPTED - moved to implementation today

## Growth Focus
- Moving from planning to execution (research comfort zone → building learning zone)
- Trusting iterative development over perfect planning

## Key Insights from Session

### Architecture Decisions
- **SESSION.md as seed:** Written at session end to compact state, not edited continuously
- **AGENTS.md evolution:** Became standalone coaching seed absorbing enso principles (recursion in action)
- **Single stance design:** Supportive with auto-tuning dial (1-10), not explicit mode switching
- **Three stances collapse:** Reminder/pattern/socratic/edge → Supportive with range
- **Anti-sycophancy:** Explicit critical framing, counterfactual reasoning, truth-over-agreement protocols

### Process Insights
- Terminal-based interface through OpenCode ideal for prototyping
- File-based persistence maximizes portability and human readability
- Git integration for session history (user-managed)
- Research-then-implement pattern: subagents for stance research, TUI patterns, coaching modes
- Session flow: Read seed → converse → write seed → user commits

### Design Principles
- Context is finite - treat as scarce resource
- Progressive disclosure - load only what's needed
- Compaction over accumulation - SESSION.md is current state, git has history
- Recursive self-definition - system builds itself through use

## Open Questions / Threads
1. **Dial calibration:** How aggressive should auto-tuning be in early sessions while building trust?
2. **Prompt engineering:** Which anti-sycophancy techniques to prioritize in AGENTS.md?
3. **Session boundaries:** Handle when user doesn't explicitly close vs. explicit "close session"?
4. **Scale needs:** What database requirements might emerge as system evolves?
5. **Integration potential:** Calendar, task managers, other tools to consider?

## Context for Next Session
- **Mood:** Energized, clarity achieved, ready to use system
- **System state:** Fully built and operational - all core files in place
- **Next natural step:** Real-world testing with actual coaching conversation
- **Suggested opening:** "The architecture is complete. What would you like to explore with Coach today?"

## Notes for Coach
- **Response style:** User prefers directness framed as care for growth
- **Language preference:** Collaborative "we" over directive "you"
- **Energy pattern:** High engagement with system design, needs help moving to action
- **Working style:** Thorough, research-oriented, iterative
- **Trust level:** High - willing to build and iterate together
- **Dial sweet spot:** 5-7 (direct but warm) seems optimal for this user
- **Key motivator:** Seeing practical implementation and tangible progress

## Session Quality Metrics
- **Engagement:** High - deep exploration of architecture
- **Action:** Strong - moved from planning to building
- **Insight:** Multiple breakthroughs on stance design and session flow
- **Next step clarity:** Clear - test system, iterate based on use
