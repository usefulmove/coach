# Session Seed

## Standing Commitments
- [x] Meditate daily at 10:00 a.m. (ONGOING)
- [ ] Prepare Enso framework presentation for internal team (THIS WEEK - now in detail phase)
- [ ] Rest and restore before next push on Enso work

## Active Priorities
1. **Enso Presentation:** Fill in details (high-level story complete, aligned with Russ)
2. **Cherry Line:** Awaiting Russ callback if needed
3. **Meditation Practice:** Continue 10 a.m. daily sits

## Avoidance Patterns Flagged
- **Previous:** Splitting attention between multiple projects - RESOLVED through sequential execution
- **None observed today** - user was direct about fatigue and made wise choice to rest

## Growth Focus
- Self-regulation: recognizing capacity limits and honoring rest as productive
- Sustained execution: maintaining momentum on Enso presentation through detail work

## Key Insights from Session
- **Stakeholder alignment creates space:** Russ conversation closed alignment loop, freeing mental bandwidth for execution
- **High-level story locked:** Enso presentation foundation is solid, now in implementation (detail) phase
- **Wise rest is growth:** User acknowledged fatigue and chose restoration over martyrdom
- **Progress feels good:** User reported relief at having direction and making progress

## Open Questions / Threads
- **Cherry Line:** Any follow-up needed from Russ on training code review?
- **Enso Presentation:** Timeline for presentation delivery this week?
- **Meditation:** Has user chosen practice format yet? (A, B, or C from session 2)

## Context for Next Session
- **Current state:** User is resting after acknowledging fatigue
- **Energy management:** Physical rest now will enable better creative work later
- **Outstanding work:** Enso presentation detail work resumes after restoration
- **Start with:** "Welcome back. How's your energy? Ready to continue filling in the Enso details?"

## Notes for Coach
- **Momentum is good:** Enso work has clear direction and stakeholder alignment
- **Self-awareness signal:** Choosing rest demonstrates maturity in self-regulation
- **Previous pattern broken:** No sign of attention-splitting; focused on single thread
- **Supportive dial:** Keep around 4-5 - warm but direct, user is in execution mode
- **Fatigue type:** Physical/capacity, not confusion or overwhelm - rest is the right prescription
