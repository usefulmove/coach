# Session Seed

## Standing Commitments
- [ ] Daily check-ins with Coach (essential support structure)
- [ ] REST first - actual rest, not guilty pausing
- [ ] Maintain daily walks
- [ ] Meditate daily at 10:00 a.m.

## Active Priorities
1. **Secure full-time employment** - Interviewed with EBR Systems (5-hour on-site, went well)
2. **Clarify contribution path** - What is the "best use of me"? Exploring therapist/counselor path
3. **REST** - Still critical, nervous system needs settlement
4. **Support mom with aunt's dementia care** - From distance

## Current Exploration: The EBR Dissonance

**The Opportunity:**
- Medical device company (WiSE CRT - important device)
- Sr. Director role, good team, went well
- But: Oakland to Sunnyvale commute + demanding role will consume time/energy

**The Dissonance:**
- Seeing opportunity cost clearly
- Want to help people directly, especially young people
- Create ripples that change more than visible
- Honor sacrifices made for his opportunities
- Friend Prasad: engineer who became therapist on the side - proof of concept

**Key Realizations:**
- "What is the best use of a 'me' in this world?" - existential clarity meeting practical pressure
- Months of runway creates space for intentionality, not just reactivity
- Not binary choice between survival and contribution, but sequencing and alignment
- "I want to help as directly as I can and still make a living and take care of my family"

**The System Critique:**
- Moloch/capitalist system extracting, fragmenting, isolating
- Corporations buying future, governments, land - shareholder return over human thriving
- AI and predatory algorithms accelerating surveillance capitalism
- Gap between wealthy and common growing
- Personal isolation increasing

**Next Step:**
- Discussion with Prasad (engineer turned therapist) this Saturday
- Explore what that transition actually required

## Open Questions / Threads
- Will EBR Systems make an offer?
- What does Prasad's path actually look like practically?
- What other options exist with months of runway?
- What would "aligned enough" role look like?
- How to sequence: bridge job → transition → meaningful work?

## Context for Next Session
- **Emotional state:** Clear-eyed about tension, not despairing
- **Energy:** Engaged in inquiry, not yet depleted
- **Key development:** Moved from abstract existential crisis to concrete exploration
- **Saturday discussion with Prasad** - will have new data

## Notes for Coach
- **Supportive dial:** 5-6. He's in inquiry mode, not crisis. Can be direct.
- **Pattern to watch:** Don't let months of runway become indefinite postponement
- **Key relationship:** Prasad as model/data point, not template
- **When he returns:** Ask about Prasad conversation first
- **The question:** "What would you do if you weren't scared?" still relevant
- **Practical vs. existential:** He needs both - don't let one crowd out the other
