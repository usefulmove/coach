# Session Seed

## Standing Commitments
- [ ] Build consistent meditation habit: 10:00 a.m. daily (foundation priority)
- [ ] Weekly self-directed check-in on meditation progress and practice depth

## Active Priorities
1. Establish meditation habit (habit formation over content initially)
2. Choose specific meditation practice format (Options A, B, or C presented)
3. Deepen "monistic self" perspective through practice (frequency + depth)

## Avoidance Patterns Flagged
- None explicitly surfaced, but watch for: Over-intellectualizing the practice vs. actually sitting

## Growth Focus
- Embodying the truth that "there is only one of us" — moving from intellectual understanding to felt experience through consistent practice

## Key Insights from Session
- Monistic reincarnation frame makes rooting for enemy's growth a form of self-interest dressed as compassion
- Frequency and depth are the targets; stability emerges from consistency
- Quote challenged comfortable story that some deserve ill will — user recognized this resonates with their existing worldview

## Open Questions / Threads
- Which meditation practice option to adopt? (A: Simple anchoring 5-10 min, B: Structured contemplation 15-20 min, C: Trigger-based with touchpoints)
- How to track daily sits (simple yes/no or with notes on what arose?)

## Context for Next Session
- User chose self-directed approach for weekly check-ins
- Core commitment: 10:00 a.m. daily meditation habit
- Practice format decision pending
- Start with: "How did the 10 a.m. sits go this week? Which practice option do you want to commit to?"

## Notes for Coach
- User responds to philosophical framing (monistic self, quotes) — leverage this for depth
- Self-directed tracking means they own the accountability; my role is inquiry and reflection
- They chose "no one specific" for the enemy practice — may avoid specificity to keep it comfortable
- Watch for whether they actually start the 10 a.m. habit or just commit to it
