# Session Seed

## Standing Commitments
- [ ] Daily check-ins with Coach (NEW - essential support structure)
- [ ] Get back to HR rep about scheduling 5-hour in-person interview
- [ ] Postpone Cherry Line meeting (call made, awaiting callback)
- [ ] Technical work on Cherry Line tomorrow (now that pressure released)
- [ ] Meditate daily at 10:00 a.m. (carry forward)
- [ ] Maintain daily walks (carry forward)

## Active Priorities
1. **Secure full-time employment** - Medical device Sr. Director role is promising path; need consistent revenue
2. **Support mom with aunt's dementia care** - From halfway across country, feeling helpless
3. **Address financial pressures** - $24k repair gap, back taxes, health insurance gap

## Avoidance Patterns Flagged
- **Pattern: Capacity overwhelm paralysis**
  - **Avoiding:** Cherry Line work, taxes, health maintenance
  - **Likely reason:** Competing survival needs make everything feel like too much
  - **Cost:** Not showing up for opportunities that could actually help (job interview went well!)
  - **Key insight:** Not laziness—legitimate capacity issue

- **Pattern: Taking on obligations that compete with survival**
  - **Avoiding:** Contract work without contract in place
  - **Likely reason:** Desire to help + fear of being difficult
  - **Cost:** Energy drain from unclear boundaries

## Growth Focus
- Naming real needs vs. defaulting to "I should be able to handle this"
- Using voice to set boundaries (made the call—proof of capacity)
- Reaching out instead of carrying alone (established daily check-in structure)

## Key Insights from Session
- **Cherry Line procrastination was a symptom**, not the root cause
- **Realization:** Need full-time job, not piecemeal contract work—contract work adds stress without solving core need
- **Made the hard call:** Postponed meeting by phone instead of hiding in avoidance
- **Loneliness acknowledged:** Empty nest, no partner, geographic distance from family—this is real and matters
- **Interview went well:** More interested in position than expected—potential lifeline

## Open Questions / Threads
- Will he call back about postponing Cherry Line meeting?
- When to schedule medical device in-person interview?
- How to support mom from distance (financially, emotionally, practically)?
- Back taxes project—when to engage?
- Health maintenance—what can be done without insurance?

## Context for Next Session
- **Emotional state:** Vulnerable but clearer. Named the loneliness, named the real needs.
- **Energy:** Just made a hard call; some relief but still carrying heavy load
- **Start with:** "How are you this morning? Did you hear back from him?"
- **Key relationship moment:** He asked for daily check-ins—this is a new level of trust and need

## Notes for Coach
- **Significant shift:** Moved from project-level coaching to life-level support. He's carrying enormous load alone.
- **Supportive dial:** 4-5. He's naming hard truths but also needs warmth. Don't push; witness.
- **Pattern to watch:** He's been "fine" carrying impossible weight. Watch for minimizing language ("most of the time it's not an issue").
- **The ask for daily check-ins is huge:** This is someone who's been holding it all alone admitting he can't. Honor that.
- **Medical device interview:** Frame as potential lifeline, not pressure. He's more interested than expected—encourage that curiosity.
- **Mom situation:** Real emotional weight here. Don't problem-solve unless he asks. Just hold space.
- **Taxes:** Major avoidance item. Don't push unless he's ready. There's only so much he can hold.
- **Tonight's homework:** Rest. That's it. He doesn't need to earn rest.
