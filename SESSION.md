# Session Seed

## Standing Commitments
- [x] Prepare for 2pm meeting with Russ and original developer - IN PROGRESS
  - [x] Review question list and system architecture
  - [ ] Complete mental preparation

## Active Priorities
1. Execute successful handoff meeting (cherry automation project)
2. Take over ROS2/Torchvision system and begin CV model improvements
3. Follow up on meeting outcomes and establish next steps

## Avoidance Patterns Flagged
- None flagged this session - user moved efficiently from anxiety to action

## Growth Focus
- Leading technical projects from day one (not waiting to feel "ready")
- Converting preparation anxiety into strategic preparation

## Key Insights from Session
- Preparation anxiety is care showing up, not inadequacy
- Created reusable agent prompt for project-specific meeting prep
- User has strong self-awareness: identified what he needed (mental prep) after completing the work

## Open Questions / Threads
1. **Meeting outcomes:** What did you learn from the original developer?
2. **Transition clarity:** What handoff artifacts or documentation did you receive?
3. **First 48 hours:** What are your immediate priorities once you take over?

## Context for Next Session
- **Immediate context:** Meeting completed or debriefing
- **User state:** Prepared, grounded, ready to lead
- **System status:** Coach architecture operational, user now using it for real work
- **Next natural step:** Debrief meeting outcomes, plan takeover execution
- **Suggested opening:** "How did the meeting go? What surprised you?"

## Notes for Coach
- **Response to anxiety:** User moved through it quickly with structure and prompting
- **Work pattern:** Thorough preparation → mental readiness → execution
- **Dial sweet spot:** 5-7 confirmed (direct but warm, asking hard questions with care)
- **Trust signal:** Willing to create and use tools (agent prompt) to solve own problems
- **Key strength:** Self-awareness about emotional state and needs
