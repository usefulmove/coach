# Session Seed

## Standing Commitments
- [x] Meditate daily at 10:00 a.m. (ONGOING)
- [x] Prepare Enso framework presentation for internal team (COMPLETE)
- [ ] Rest and meditate this afternoon (TODAY)

## Active Priorities
1. **Emotional restoration:** Rest and meditation this afternoon to recover from wrestling with world-heaviness
2. **Meditation practice:** Continue daily 10 a.m. sits
3. **Cherry Line:** Still awaiting Russ callback if needed

## Avoidance Patterns Flagged
- **Pattern: "Should" override on rest needs**
  - **Avoiding:** Permission to rest when emotionally exhausted
  - **Likely reason:** Internalized productivity voice; belief that external crisis demands constant engagement
  - **Cost if continues:** Burnout, diminished capacity to contribute meaningfully

## Growth Focus
- Acceptance without resistance: holding "this is what is" without "this should be different"
- Self-regulation: recognizing rest as stewardship, not surrender

## Key Insights from Session
- **Anchor found:** Bad Bunny's Super Bowl performance—message of togetherness in face of ugliness; "I can't give up because they never did"
- **Lineage matters:** User carries forward the fight of those who created a better world for them
- **Rest = capacity:** Emotional exhaustion from engaging with evil/darkness requires restoration to maintain ability to care
- **The "should" voice:** Productivity imperative creates suffering when reality (need for rest) doesn't conform

## Open Questions / Threads
- **Cherry Line:** Any follow-up needed from Russ on training code review?
- **World engagement:** How to stay informed/caring without being consumed?
- **Meditation:** User mentioned meditating this afternoon—was this in addition to or instead of 10am sit?

## Context for Next Session
- **Current state:** User acknowledged need for rest, committed to meditation this afternoon
- **Energy management:** Wrestling with evil/world-ugliness created emotional fatigue
- **Outstanding work:** None urgent; user in restoration mode
- **Start with:** "Welcome back. How was the meditation? Did you find the space you were looking for?"

## Notes for Coach
- **Vulnerable session:** User brought heavy emotional content about state of the world; showed courage
- **Values-driven distress:** The pain comes from caring—this is feature, not bug
- **Wisdom emerging:** User can articulate what he needs (rest) even while struggling with the "should"
- **Supportive dial:** Keep warm (4-5); he's been direct and self-aware, needs holding not challenging
- **Resource:** Bad Bunny anchor and lineage quote are powerful—he may return to these
- **Pattern broken:** Chose rest over martyrdom again; reinforce this as strength
