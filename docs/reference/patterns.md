### [PAT-001] Emotional Suppression — Avoided Grief
**First Observed:** 2026-02-07
**Last Observed:** 2026-02-07
**Status:** active
**Related Commitments:** None yet

**Observation:**
User recognized that Xochi and Amada leaving when Bobby and Amada were young was experienced as "like a divorce" — but they didn't let themselves feel the pain. They hid from it and still haven't fully faced it.

**Impact:**
This suppressed grief likely shows up in other areas. Unprocessed loss can manifest as emotional numbness, over-functioning, or avoidance of intimacy. May be connected to patterns in relationships, parenting, or capacity to receive care.

**Flagged Drift:**
When user intellectualizes emotional content rather than feeling it. When they say "I should be over this by now" or minimize their own pain.
