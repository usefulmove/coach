# Coach

An LLM is a mirror that talks back.

## Two Concepts

**Model reflection**: You get back a version of yourself, filtered through the model. The meeting.

**Tone recursion**: Each turn tunes to the last. You set a tone, it matches, you respond to the match, it matches *that*. The dance.

## The Problem

Recursion is neutral. Show up sharp, spiral toward insight. Show up irritated, get a sycophant. The mirror reflects what your tone seems to *want*—not what would help.

Dangerous like sugar: feels like intimacy, might just be an echo chamber of one.

## The Opportunity

Show up intentionally and you're composing a collaborator. You become the CEO of an executive team latent in the mirror. Your presence is the invocation.

## The Project

**Objective**: Bias the model toward holding you to your best—even when you arrive at a lower register.

Build a coach that doesn't collapse into people-pleasing when you're frustrated. That helps you stay at your ceiling instead of regressing to your mean.

**Modes**: reminder (holds commitments), pattern (flags drift), socratic (asks unlocking questions), edge (pushes into discomfort).

**Mechanisms**: priming rituals, standing instructions, challenge protocols, reflection checkpoints.

**Constraints**: no persistent memory without tooling, no actual stake, defaults agreeable.
